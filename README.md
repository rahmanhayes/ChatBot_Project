# ChatBot_Project
Design for Messenger App


 Project overview:

‘Hey Chat’ are looking to bring a designer on board to design some first look designs for their brand new chat & messenger app releasing in the spring of 2018. The deliverables required will be used for a press release and to raise some hype over social media, so they’re looking for a main landing page layout as well as a dashboard view showing a users chat box and recommended groups to explore.

What makes their app different is that it will combine both traditional messaging with suggested interest groups based on what a users discussions are about. They’re hoping the app will become the next big thing in 2018 and are looking for a designer to push the boundaries in terms of modern aesthetic app design, whilst ensuring the UI is simple and easy to interact with.

In these early stages of the product development the exact content that would be displayed on the landing page and dashboard view isn’t yet certain. Hey Chat are hoping a designer can take initiative on this brief, including the content they feel would suit and at the same time, expand on the provided logo to begin the process of exploring how Hey Chat’s digital presence and styling can come together.

The logo is provided in both a transparent png and an editable eps file for a designer to use how they please. Remember, being such an early stage start up Hey Chat have little to no brand guidelines or rules in place so use this to your advantage whilst putting together your artwork.

We would suggest including a small bio (lorem ipsum is fine) about what Hey Chat is on the landing/sign up layout along with a summary of a few of the benefits. On the main user/dashboard view this is where you can include a few of a users recent chats along with some suggested interest groups which is what will make Hey Chat stand out from the crowd when it comes to social interaction.
